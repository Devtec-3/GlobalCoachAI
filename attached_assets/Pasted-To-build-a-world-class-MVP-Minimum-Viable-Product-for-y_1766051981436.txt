To build a world-class MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for your SIWES defense, you need a structured **Technical Requirement Document (TRD)**. This is what a professional Lead Developer would hand to a team to ensure the project is "unique and amazing."

## 🏛️ Project Architecture: "GlobalCareer AI"

### 1. Frontend: The Angular Engine

* **Version:** Angular 18/19 (Standalone Components).
* **State Management:** Angular Signals (for real-time notification updates).
* **Form Handling:** `ReactiveFormsModule` (Essential for the complex multi-step CV form).
* **UI Library:** **Tailwind CSS** + **DaisyUI** (for a sleek, modern look) or **Angular Material**.

### 2. Backend: The Logic Hub

* **Framework:** **Node.js with Express** (Fast and scalable).
* **AI Integration:** **Google Gemini API** (Free tier available, excellent at text processing).
* **Database:** **MongoDB** (To store flexible user profiles and CV data).
* **Authentication:** **Firebase Auth** (Handles Sign-up, Email Verification, and "Forgot Password" out of the box).

---

## 🛠️ Phase-by-Phase MVP Implementation

### Phase 1: Identity & Security (The Foundation)

* **Feature:** Secure Authentication.
* **Developer Task:**
* Integrate Firebase SDK into Angular.
* Create `login`, `signup`, and `forgot-password` components.
* **The "Special" Touch:** On successful signup, use a Firebase Cloud Function to send a "Welcome to the Future of your Career" HTML email template.



### Phase 2: The "Global-Standard" CV Builder

* **Feature:** Smart Data Collection.
* **Developer Task:** * Build a **Stepper Form** (Personal Info → Education → Experience → Skills).
* **AI Optimization Button:** Add a button next to the "Experience" field. When clicked, it sends the user's raw text to the backend.
* **Prompt Engineering:** The backend sends this to Gemini:
> *"Rewrite the following job duty into a high-impact, ATS-friendly achievement using action verbs and metrics: [User Text]."*


* **PDF Generation:** Use `jspdf` to export a clean, **single-column** layout (Global standard for ATS).



### Phase 3: AI Opportunity Matcher & Notifications

* **Feature:** Personalized Job Discovery.
* **Developer Task:**
* Create a "Jobs" tab.
* **The Match Logic:** The AI compares the `User.skills` array against a database of scraped or mock opportunities.
* **Notification System:** Use **Socket.io** or Firebase Cloud Messaging to send a popup: *"Hey [Name], a new Internship at Google matches 85% of your profile!"*



### Phase 4: Application Tracker (The Record of Achievement)

* **Feature:** The "Success Log."
* **Developer Task:**
* Create a Kanban board (To-Apply | Applied | Interviewing | Hired).
* **AI Insight:** When a user moves a job to "Applied," the AI asks: *"Would you like me to generate a custom Cover Letter for this specific company?"*
* This tracks the "Achievement Record" you mentioned for your defense.

## 💻 Core Code Snippets (For your Developer)

### The AI Service (Angular)

```typescript
// ai-optimizer.service.ts
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

export class AiService {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  optimizeAchievement(text: string) {
    return this.http.post('/api/ai/optimize', { content: text });
  }
}

```

### The Backend AI Logic (Node.js)

```javascript
// server.js (using Gemini API)
app.post('/api/ai/optimize', async (req, res) => {
  const { content } = req.body;
  const prompt = `Act as a world-class career coach. Rewrite this for a CV: ${content}`;
  const result = await geminiModel.generateContent(prompt);
  res.json({ optimizedText: result.response.text() });
});

```

## 🏆 Defense Strategy: Why this is "Special"

When presenting to your SIWES supervisors, emphasize these **Three Unique Selling Points (USPs)**:

1. **ATS-First Design:** "Most apps make pretty CVs; mine makes **hirable** CVs that pass through robot filters."
2. **Proactive Assistance:** "The app doesn't wait for the user; it notifies them when a global opportunity matches their specific skill set."
3. **The Feedback Loop:** "By tracking successful applications, the AI learns which version of the user's CV performs best in the real world."

## 👨‍💻 Global Developer Advice

To be a "Best in the World" developer for this project:

1. **Keep it Clean:** Use a modular folder structure in Angular (`/core`, `/shared`, `/features`).
2. **Speed Matters:** Use **Lazy Loading** so the app loads instantly.
3. **User Experience (UX):** Use "Loading Shimmers" while the AI is generating text so the user knows the "brain" is working.

**Would you like me to generate a sample "Prompt Engineering" script that the AI will use to ensure the CV meets global standards?**
